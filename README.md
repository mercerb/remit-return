# remit-return
Final Project for 6.C85, Interactive Data Visualization &amp; Society. This project focuses on the remittances associated with migration from the Northern Triangle and if that money sent back offsets the cost of migration.

# Data
World Bank data is available in the `remit-return/remitreturn/wb-data/` directory. Class data must remain offline (private). Download the folder `dataset-1_central-american-survey` locally to your computer and place it in the `remit-return/remitreturn/src/class-data/` folder. Then you can run the data prep files.

# Local
## Running the code
`cd remitreturn`
`npm install`
`npm run dev --open`

## Then go to:
`http://localhost:5173/`

# Published
# Publish to GitHub
`cd remitreturn`
`npm run gh-pages`
Then, don't forget to add the .nojekyll file back to the branch!
Go to https://github.com/mercerb/remit-return/tree/gh-pages and Add file -> Create new file. Title the file ".nojekyll" and leave it empty. It'll sit at the root of the repo.
