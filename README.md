# remit-return
Final Project for 6.C85, Interactive Data Visualization &amp; Society. This project focuses on the remittances associated with migration from the Northern Triangle and if that money sent back offsets the cost of migration.

# Data
World Bank data is available in the wb-data/ directory. Class data must remain offline (private). Download the folder `dataset-1_central-american-survey` locally to your computer and place it in the `remit-return/class-data/` folder. Then you can run the data prep files.

# Running the code
cd remitreturn
npm install
npm run dev --open

# Then go to:
