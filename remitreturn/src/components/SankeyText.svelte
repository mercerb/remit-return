        The above sankey chart represents the occupations for migrants before
        and after their migration to the US. There are 8 different categories of
        occupations. Before migration, across all the categories, the
        agricultural sector has the most workers, with 392. The "student" and
        "informal work" categories also have over 300 people each.

        After migration, many of the migrants change jobs. By hovering over the
        origin country occupation nodes, we get perspective regarding changes
        for people for a particular occupation when they move to the US.
        Hovering over the US occupation nodes, we can see how people from
        different occupations in the origin countries take up jobs in a new
        occupation category. For example, 458 migrants in the US do "informal
        work." This group includes many who did informal work before, but also
        former farmers, students, and business owners, among others.
