        As seen in the above graph, the time it takes to pay off the cost of the
        migration depends on the job secured by the migrant in the destination
        country and the amount of money they send back as remittances every
        month. It can take as little as 1 month to work off the cost of the
        migration and begin contributing to the economy, but for more expensive
        migrations, the payback period can be as long as a year.

        The orange bars represent two migrants who paid thousands of US dollars
        to migrate but were sent back to their country of origin. They never had
        a chance to pay off the amount they invested in the migration. They
        never had the opportunity to work in the US, contribute to its economy,
        and send money back home.
