        As seen in the above graph, the time it takes to pay off the cost of the
        migration depends on the job secured by the migrant in the destination
        country and the amount of money they send back as remittances every
        month. It can take as little as 1 month to work off the cost of the
        migration and begin contributing to the economy, but for more expensive
        migrations, the payback period can be over a year (in some cases not
        shown on this chart).

        The orange bars represent the two migrants above who paid thousands of
        US dollars to migrate but were sent back to their country of origin.
        They never had a chance to pay off the amount they invested in the
        migration. They never had the opportunity to work in the US, contribute
        to its economy, and send money back home.

        Finally, let's look at the economic impact of all the migrants in this
        dataset who currently reside in their destination of the US. Scroll down
        to see the monetary contribution of migrants to the Northern Triangle
        and US projected for a little over a year after migrating.
