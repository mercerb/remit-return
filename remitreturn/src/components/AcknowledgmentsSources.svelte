        As mentioned on the main page, the project was completed by Mercer
        Borris, Ahsan Imran, and Shelby Unger for 6.C85, the "Interactive Data
        Visualization and Society" class, in the spring of 2023. Thanks to all
        team members for working together and supporting each other in various
        phases of the project. Thanks to the professors, the TAs
    </p>
    <h4>Data Sources</h4>

        This data visualization was made with data contributed by the <b

    <h4>Data Processing</h4>
    <p>
        The data displayed here is a subset of the class data. This subset
        includes 454 individuals who reported a cost of migration and whose
        destination was the United States. Of these, 349 currently reside in the
        USA and send remittances back to their families (as of the time of the
        survey, April 2021). 105 paid the cost of migration but either did not
        make it to the USA or were sent back.
