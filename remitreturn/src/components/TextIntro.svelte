        As seen in the above chart, economic insecurity is the leading cause of
        migration (source: UN World Food Programme, April 2021 survey of
        Northern Triangle inhabitants). Despite the financial and emotional
        costs associated with migrating from the Northern Triangle (El Salvador,
        Honduras, and Guatemala) to the United States, indviduals take on this
        burden every year in search of better salaries, working conditions, and
        opportunities to send money home.

    <p>
        Migrants who end up working in the destination country long enough not
        only offset the cost of their migration and send remittances home, but
        also spend money in the United States (for food, housing, etc),
        invigorating the economy.

            Is the cost worth it? At what point do working migrants offset that
            cost? How much are they contributing to the US economy depending on
            what jobs are available?
        </b> First, we need to understand what their earning potential is based on
        the roles they are able to hold in the destination country.
