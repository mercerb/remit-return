        Economic insecurity is the leading cause of migration. Despite the
        financial and emotional costs associated with migrating from the
        Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala) to the United
        States, indviduals take on this burden every year in search of better
        salaries, working conditions, and opportunities to send money home.
    </p>

    <p>
        Migrants who end up working in the destination country long enough not
        only offset the cost of their migration and send remittances home, but
        also spend money in the United States (for food, housing, etc),
        invigorating the economy.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Is the cost worth it? At what point do working migrants offset that
            cost? How much are they contributing to the US economy depending on
            what jobs are available?
        </b> First, we need to understand what their earning potential is based on
        the roles they are able to hold in the destination country.
