        Economic insecurity is the leading cause of migration. Despite the costs
        - both financial and emotional - associated with migrating from the
        Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala) to the United
        States, indviduals take on this burden year after year in search of
        better salaries, working conditions, and opportunities to send money
        home. Migrants who end up working in the destination country long enough
        not only offset the cost of their migration and send remittances home,
        but also spend money in the United States (for food, housing, etc),
        invigorating the economy.

        The data displayed here is a subset of the class data. This subset
        includes 454 individuals who reported a cost of migration and whose
        destination was the United States. Of these, 349 currently reside in the
        USA and send remittances back to their families (as of the time of the
        survey, April 2021). 105 paid the cost of migration but either did not
        make it to the USA or were sent back.

        Is the cost worth it? At what point do working migrants offset that
        cost? How much are they contributing to the US economy depending on what
        jobs are available? To better understand the tradeoff between the cost
        of migration, remittances, and money entering the USA, we have
        identified 10 migrants who represent a statistically similar sample of
        this larger group.
