    <h2>RemitReturn: Sources and Methodology</h2>

    <p>
        The data displayed here is a subset of the class data. This subset
        includes 454 individuals who reported a cost of migration and whose
        destination was the United States. Of these, 349 currently reside in the
        USA and send remittances back to their families (as of the time of the
        survey, April 2021). 105 paid the cost of migration but either did not
        make it to the USA or were sent back.
    </p>

    <p>
        Is the cost worth it? At what point do working migrants offset that
        cost? How much are they contributing to the US economy depending on what
        jobs are available? To better understand the tradeoff between the cost
        of migration, remittances, and money entering the USA, we have
        identified 10 migrants who represent a statistically similar sample of
        this larger group.
